# LexiconGoHP Project

This is my LexiconGoHP project, created as part of my midterm for the course **CIST 005A: Introduction to Python** (Section / CRN: 75249) at West Valley College. This project was developed using Python to practice my programming skills and mix three of my favorite thingsâ€”Harry Potter, word games, and Python programming.

## Project Description

In this project, users can play a word game inspired by Lexicon Go! with elements of Harry Potter. It was developed using Python and incorporates features like user input, conditional statements, loops, and string manipulation. 

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.
3. Run the `lexicon.py` script.

## Future ideas: 

Although the original file has been submitted for grading already, I will continue to add to this project as I learn more and more programming. 

Please send me a message if you need more information or would like to help with this project.
